## Purpose
Modals present critical information or prompt users for input. Modals intentionally interrupt a user’s path by blocking access to the main content until the task is completed or the user dismisses the Modal.

## Rules
- **MUST** use the Living Design Modal component.
- **MUST** trap focus while open and restore focus to the trigger on close.
- **MUST** provide an accessible name (title).
- **MUST** open in response to user interaction with an interactive element (e.g., a [Button](/components/button/)).
- **MUST NOT** create ad-hoc overlays with raw CSS.
- **MUST NOT** layer a Modal on top of Bottom Sheet, Panel, or another Modal.
- **MUST NOT** modify Modal to cover the full screen; respect the Modal’s documented size and margin constraints.
- **SHOULD** use Modals sparingly to limit disruption to the user.
- **SHOULD NOT** use a Modal to display system errors; consider using an [Alert](/components/alert/) instead.

## Sizes
A Modal Container’s width is controlled by a `size` prop (names may differ in your API). Respecting responsive margins, the `size` dictates the Container’s maximum width.

## React usage (example)
Update import path after wiring in `guidelines/components/overview-components.md`.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Button, Modal } from "REPLACE_ME_COMPONENT_IMPORT_PATH";

export function ModalExample() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Edit details</Button>

      <Modal
        // Adapt prop names to your actual API:
        // open={open}
        // onOpenChange={setOpen}
        // title="Edit details" // accessible name; used for aria-labelledby
        // size="sm" | "md" | "lg"
        // closeOnScrimClick={true}
        // closeOnEscape={true}
        open={open}
        onOpenChange={setOpen}
        title="Edit details"
        size="md"
      >
        {/* Content */}
        <div>
          Make changes and then save. You can close the modal to discard changes.
        </div>

        {/* Action content (optional): fixed-position area for actions */}
        <div>
          <Button onClick={() => setOpen(false)} variant="secondary">
            Cancel
          </Button>
          <Button onClick={() => setOpen(false)}>Save</Button>
        </div>
      </Modal>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Usage
Use when briefly interrupting the user's current journey for short, infrequent tasks (such as edits or management).

Don’t use when the user must complete complex or repeated tasks; consider using a new screen instead.

### Size
A Modal maintains responsive margins; within those margins, `size` determines the maximum container width.

## Examples

## Best practices
### Use when
- Use when briefly interrupting the user's current journey.
- Use when user needs to complete short, infrequent tasks, such as edits or management.

### Don't use when
- Don't use when the user must complete complex or repeated tasks. Consider using a new screen instead.

### Do
- Do open a Modal in response to user interaction with an interactive element, such as a [Button](/components/button/).

### Don't
- Don't layer a Modal on top of Bottom Sheet, Panel, or another Modal.
- Don't use a Modal to display system errors. Consider using an [Alert](/components/alert/) for error messaging.
- Don't use a Modal to contain the amount of interaction and content usually found on a separate screen.
- Don't modify Modal to cover the full screen. Respect the Modal's size and margin constraints.

## Placement
Modals are centered within a screen. They maintain a margin around them so users understand they are a temporary overlay on top of content.

## Anatomy
![Anatomy of modal component](./modal-web-anatomy-1.png)

Modal
1. Layout container
2. Scrim
3. Container
4. Header
5. Content
6. Action content (optional)

![Anatomy of modal component](./modal-web-anatomy-2.png)

ModalHeader
1. Container
2. Title
3. Close button

### Action content
Action content (a nested component) is a fixed-position area at the bottom of a Modal that allows for flexibility of content. It should contain interactive elements, such as [Button](/components/button/), that relate to the Modal's content.

### Title
The Modal's title is always left-aligned.

The Modal's title should not exceed two lines. Consult with Content Strategy for circumstances where the title of your Modal is more than a few words.

## Behavior
### Closing
A Modal can be closed in the following ways (when enabled in the component API):
1. Clicking or tapping on the Close icon
2. Clicking or tapping on the underlying scrim
3. Pressing the ESC key on the keyboard

### Responsiveness
#### Margins
A Modal maintains separation from the screen's edge with margins, which indicates the Modal’s temporary nature to users.

Minimum margins are responsively set on the system's breakpoints:
1. **Large and above:** `64` pixels on all sides
2. **Medium:** `32` pixels on all sides
3. **Small:** `16` pixels on all sides

#### Height
Modal height should be determined by the content within the Modal. The maximum height of a Modal is 100% viewport height minus the required margins as described above.

## Accessibility
- **MUST** trap focus while open and prevent interaction with underlying content.
- **MUST** return focus to the element that triggered the Modal when it closes.
- **SHOULD** avoid launching a snackbar when closing a Modal. Focus will not be on the Snackbar so it won't be announced by screen readers.
  - It's possible to work around this behavior by adding a 1-second delay before firing the Snackbar. See the Snackbar docs/FAQ in your system for a web-specific workaround.

## Token usage
- Prefer component defaults (Modal should be token-wired for elevation/scrim, radius, typography, spacing).
- Only use tokens for layout around the Modal, not for restyling the Modal.
