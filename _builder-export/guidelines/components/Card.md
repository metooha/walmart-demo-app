## Purpose
Cards are used to display content and actions for a single subject or concept. They help users quickly scan information, understand hierarchy, and take associated actions.

## Rules
- **MUST** use Living Design Card component when available.
- **MUST** use surface/border/elevation tokens; no raw values.
- **SHOULD** keep each Card focused on a single subject/concept.
- **SHOULD** place distinct topics in separate Cards (avoid putting multiple topics inside one Card).
- **MUST NOT** place Cards within Cards.

## Usage
Cards can include various forms of media (photos, graphics, illustrations, video), headers, supporting text, dividers, icons, and buttons.

### Size
Card size (if supported by your API) should control the container’s width and/or padding scale. Use documented sizes only (names may differ in your API).

## React usage (example)
Update import path after wiring in `guidelines/components/overview-components.md`.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import {
  Card,
  // If your API exposes subcomponents, it may look like:
  // CardMedia,
  // CardHeader,
  // CardContent,
  // CardActions,
  Button,
} from "REPLACE_ME_COMPONENT_IMPORT_PATH";

export function CardExample() {
  return (
    <Card
      // Adapt prop names to your actual API:
      // size="sm" | "md" | "lg"
      // interactive={false} // if supported
    >
      {/* Media (optional) */}
      {/* <CardMedia>
        <img alt="Product" src="/path/to/image.jpg" />
      </CardMedia> */}

      {/* Header (optional) */}
      {/* <CardHeader title="Card title" leadingIcon={<Icon />} trailing={<Tag>New</Tag>} /> */}

      {/* Content */}
      {/* <CardContent> */}
      <div>
        <strong>Card title</strong>
        <div>Supporting text that explains the content and sets context.</div>
      </div>
      {/* </CardContent> */}

      {/* Actions (optional) */}
      {/* <CardActions> */}
      <div>
        <Button variant="secondary">Learn more</Button>
        <Button>Continue</Button>
      </div>
      {/* </CardActions> */}
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## Token usage
- The Card uses the surface color token.

## Examples
- Example of Card with header.
- Example of Cards with full bleed and padded media content.

## Best practices
### Use when
- Use when topics need to be organized in a format that is easily consumable by the user.

### Don't use when
- Don't use when there are multiple topics within a screen. Putting multiple topics within a single Card diminishes its visual impact, hierarchy and actionability. Place distinct topics in separate Cards.

## Placement
### Do
Do use Cards together. Align them horizontally, vertically, or both as needed.

### Don't
Don't place Cards within Cards.

### Caution
Placing content over media can result in unexpected results, including ADA violations.
