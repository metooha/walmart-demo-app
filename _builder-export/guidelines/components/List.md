## Purpose
Lists present a continuous, vertical group of related information. They are composed of items that may include text and optional leading/trailing elements (icons/spot icons/images), and **should include at least one action**.

## Rules
- **MUST** ensure the List contains at least one action (per item or for the list as a whole).
- **MUST** use documented item layouts only (leading/title/content/trailing as supported).
- **MUST** keep leading/trailing elements meaningful; they should add context/clarity.
- **MUST NOT** add repeating decorative elements (e.g., identical icons) purely for visual decoration.
- **MUST NOT** use the List component for a simple vertical collection of single-line text. Use native HTML list semantics (`<ul>`, `<ol>`) or platform-native list patterns instead.
- **MUST** support focus-visible and keyboard interaction for any interactive list items.
- **MUST NOT** restyle List internals via custom CSS if the component already provides the styling.

## Usage
Use List when displaying a vertical collection of similar items that share context, especially when items:
- Have a title + supporting content
- Have optional leading/trailing affordances (e.g., icon, status, chevron)
- Are actionable (row action, secondary action, navigation, etc.)

## Variants
Use documented List variants only (e.g., density, separators, leading/trailing configurations) as supported by your component API.

## States
If list items are interactive, support the documented interaction states:
- Default
- Hover/active (web)
- Focus-visible
- Disabled (if supported)

## Accessibility
- If the List is primarily **content**, ensure it exposes appropriate list semantics (e.g., list + listitem structure) as supported by the component.
- If a list item is **clickable**, it **MUST** expose the correct interactive semantics (e.g., `button` for in-place actions, `link` for navigation) and have a clear accessible name.
- Interactive elements inside a list item **MUST** be reachable by keyboard and have a visible focus indicator.
- Avoid nested interactive controls that create ambiguous click targets; prefer one primary action per row unless the component explicitly supports secondary actions.

## Token usage
- Prefer component defaults (List should be token-wired for spacing, typography, separators, and states).
- Only use tokens for layout around the List (spacing), not to restyle List items.

## React usage (example)
Update import path after wiring in `guidelines/components/overview-components.md`.

```tsx
import { List, ListItem } from "REPLACE_ME_COMPONENT_IMPORT_PATH";

export function Example() {
  return (
    <List aria-label="Settings">
      <ListItem
        title="Notifications"
        content="Push and email preferences"
        onClick={() => {}}
      />
      <ListItem
        title="Security"
        content="Password, MFA, and sessions"
        onClick={() => {}}
      />
    </List>
  );
}
```

## Best practices
### Use when
- Use when displaying a vertical collection of similar items that have shared context.

### Don’t use when
- Don't use when displaying a vertical collection of single-line text. Consider using native ordered/unordered lists instead.

## Do / Don’t
### Do
- Do include leading elements (such as icons) **only** if they add context and clarity to the List Title or the List Content.

### Don’t
- Don’t include repeating elements (such as icons) just for the sake of adding an arbitrary visual element.

## Anatomy
### List
1. Container
2. List Item
3. Separator

### List Item
1. Container
2. Leading (optional)
3. Title (optional)
4. Content
5. Trailing (optional)
