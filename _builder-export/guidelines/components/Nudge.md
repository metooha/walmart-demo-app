## Purpose
Nudges provide **non-critical, supportive** information such as reminders, instructions for a next step, or gentle upsell/cross-sell prompts. The information a Nudge provides **must not** be required for a user to complete their current task.

## Rules
- **MUST** use the Living Design Nudge component.
- **MUST** keep Nudge content **non-critical** and supportive; users must be able to complete the task without it.
- **MUST NOT** use Nudge for onboarding/coaching content anchored to a UI element; use a [Callout](/components/callout/) instead.
- **MUST NOT** use Nudge to relay errors, reinforce success, or warn about a potential issue; use an [Alert](/components/alert/) instead.
- **MUST** keep copy short and scannable.
- **MUST** ensure the most important information appears first (users often scan the first 1–2 words).
- **MUST** respect the parent container’s padding; Nudges should appear **inset** (not edge-to-edge) whether on a page or within a Card.

## Usage
Use a Nudge to:
- Clarify the usage of a feature
- Gently remind the user of something they may otherwise overlook
- Prompt a reasonable next step in a process
- Offer optional upsell/cross-sell messaging that does not block the user

## Variants
Use documented variants/options only (names may differ in your API):
- **Leading (optional)**: icon / spot icon / pictogram / illustration
- **Close button (optional)**: dismissible vs non-dismissible
- **Action content (optional)**: a single, clear action related to the message (if supported)

## States
If your Nudge implementation supports states, use documented states only:
- Default
- Dismissible (close shown) / Non-dismissible
- With leading / Without leading

## Best practices
### Use when
- Use when clarifying the usage of a feature or gently reminding the user of something they may otherwise overlook.

### Don’t use when
- Don’t use when the message contains information required for the user to complete their current task.
- Don’t use when displaying onboarding or coaching content. Use a [Callout](/components/callout/) instead.
- Don’t use when surfacing information to relay errors, reinforce success, or warn about a potential issue. Use an [Alert](/components/alert/) instead.

## Placement
Nudges should be inset within their container.

- Place Nudges so they **respect the parent container’s padding** (page padding, Card padding, panel padding, etc.).
- Avoid edge-to-edge placement inside padded containers; it reduces visual quality and breaks layout rhythm.

## Do / Don’t
### Do
- Do respect the padding of the parent component. Nudges should appear inset whether placed directly on the page or within a Card.

### Don’t
- Don’t allow a Nudge to span past the parent container’s padding and appear edge-to-edge within a page or Card.

## Anatomy
1. Container
2. Leading (optional)
3. Title
4. Close button (optional)
5. Content
6. Action content (optional)

### Leading
The leading area can be used to provide a visual cue supporting the message. Use it sparingly and only when it adds clarity.

Supported leading content (depending on your component API):
- Icon
- Spot icon
- Pictogram
- Illustration

## Accessibility
- **MUST** ensure the message is understandable without relying on the leading visual.
- If dismissible, the Close button **MUST** be keyboard reachable, have a visible focus indicator, and have an accessible name (e.g., “Dismiss”).
- If an action is present, it **MUST** be a real interactive control (button/link semantics as appropriate) and be reachable by keyboard.
- Nudge **MUST NOT** steal focus when it appears; it should be discoverable without interrupting the user’s current task.

## Token usage
- Prefer component defaults (Nudge should be token-wired for surface, spacing, typography, radius, and any elevation).
- Only use tokens for layout around the Nudge, not for restyling Nudge internals.

## React usage (example)
Update import path after wiring in `guidelines/components/overview-components.md`.

```tsx
import { Button, Nudge } from "REPLACE_ME_COMPONENT_IMPORT_PATH";

export function Example() {
  return (
    <Nudge
      // Adapt prop names to your actual API:
      // title="Tip"
      // leading={<Icon name="info" />}
      // onClose={() => {}}
      // action={<Button variant="secondary">Learn how</Button>}
    >
      You can save this view to access it faster next time.
    </Nudge>
  );
}
```
