## Purpose
Badges highlight an object to visually indicate a **count** or **status**. Badges are **not interactive**.

## Rules
- **MUST** use the Living Design Badge component.
- **MUST NOT** make Badges interactive (no click/press/hover affordances).
- **MUST** use documented semantic variants/intents; **MUST NOT** custom-color.
- **MUST NOT** use Badge for text-heavy labeling; use [Tag](/components/tag/) instead.

## Usage
Use a Badge when:
- Notifying users that an item's status has meaningfully changed.
- Associating a numeric count with an item (e.g., unread messages, selected items).

## Color / intent
The Badge color should come from documented semantic variants (names may differ in your API). If color conveys meaning, it must be reinforced by nearby text/content (do not rely on color alone).

## React usage (example)

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/Badge";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/Button";

export function BadgeExamples() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Count badge (common) */}
      <Button
        variant="secondary"
        // Preferred: include the badge count in the accessible name so SR users hear both together.
        aria-label="Inbox, 2 unread emails"
      >
        Inbox <Badge variant="info" value={2} aria-label="2 unread" />
      </Button>

      {/* Status badge (semantic intent) */}
      <div>
        Status:{" "}
        <Badge
          variant="success"
          value={1}
          aria-label="1 active item"
        />
      </div>

      {/* Dot badge (no value - status indicator only) */}
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
        <Badge variant="success" aria-label="Status: active" />
        <span>Active</span>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Component API

```tsx
interface BadgeProps {
  /**
   * The variant/intent of the badge, determines its color
   * Semantic variants: 'info' | 'success' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'neutral'
   * Color variants: 'blue' | 'green' | 'red' | 'orange' | 'purple' | 'pink' | 'teal' | 'yellow'
   */
  variant?: BadgeVariant;

  /**
   * The numeric value to display in the badge
   * If not provided, badge will render as a dot
   */
  value?: number | string;

  /**
   * Size of the badge
   * @default 'medium'
   */
  size?: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';

  /**
   * Accessible label for the badge
   * Recommended format: "{count} {description}" (e.g., "2 unread messages")
   */
  'aria-label'?: string;
}
```

### Examples

**See full examples:** `client/components/BadgeExample.tsx`

## Best practices
### Use when
- Use when notifying users that an item's status has meaningfully changed.
- Use when associating a numeric count with an item.

### Don't use when
- Don't use when a non-numeric text label would be required in the Badge. Badges should not contain text-based content or be used for other types of labeling. Consider using [Tag](/components/tag/) instead.

### Do
- Do use numerals in the Badge when tracking count is beneficial to the user.

### Don't
- Don't include text-heavy content or other types of labeling with the Badge; use [Tag](/components/tag/) instead.

## Anatomy
1. Container
2. Value (optional; typically a number)

## Behavior
### Accessibility
#### Color
Color is not accessible on its own (e.g., users with color-blindness may not distinguish variants). Consider:
- If Badge color has meaning, reinforce it with nearby supporting content.
- If you show multiple Badge colors together, users will assume meaning—be explicit about the meaning, or use a single color.
- Ensure meaning aligns with your system's [color strategy](/foundations/color#color-semantics).

For more details, see the Accessibility Checklist entry on avoiding sole use of color to convey information.

#### Badge grouping announcement
If the Badge is used together with another element (e.g., a Button or Link), the label of the associated element should include the Badge content so assistive tech announces them together as one element.

#### Specific badge labeling (preferred)
To ensure screen reader users understand the meaning of a badge number, prefer a specific label in the format:
\({count} {optional count description}\)

Examples:
- "2 selected documents"
- "12 unread emails"

## Token usage
- Prefer component defaults (Badge should be token-wired for color, typography, spacing, radius).
- Only use tokens for layout around the Badge (spacing/gaps), not for restyling the Badge.
