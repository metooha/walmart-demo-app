## Purpose
A Bottom Sheet is a modal surface that slides up from the bottom of the viewport to present additional content, longer descriptions, and simple sub-tasks. It appears as a result of user interaction and **blocks access to the main screen content** until dismissed.

## Rules
- **MUST** use the Living Design Bottom Sheet component.
- **MUST** be user-dismissible (never trap users in the Bottom Sheet).
- **MUST** provide at least one explicit dismissal control (e.g., a close button) when the sheet is dismissible.
- **MUST** block interaction with background content while open (modal behavior).
- **MUST** return focus to the element that triggered the Bottom Sheet when it closes.
- **MUST NOT** layer Bottom Sheets on top of other Bottom Sheets, modals, or panels.
- **MUST NOT** use Bottom Sheets for complex, multi-step flows; use a dedicated page/screen instead.
- **SHOULD** keep tasks short and focused (one “sub-task”).
- **SHOULD** support `Escape` to dismiss on desktop/web (when applicable).

## Usage
Use Bottom Sheets for intentional, temporary interruptions that are logically connected to what the user just did, such as:
- Entering a date
- Choosing from a short list of options
- Reviewing additional details without navigating away
- Completing a single, contained sub-task

Don’t use Bottom Sheets for:
- Complex tasks or multi-step processes that require many interactions
- System errors as the primary display pattern (use an [Alert](/components/alert) or [Error Message](/components/error-message/) instead)

Note: If a system error occurs while Bottom Sheet content is loading, it is appropriate to render the error state inside the Bottom Sheet.

## Best practices
### Use when
- Use when intentionally interrupting the user’s journey for a simple task, and the transition into this interruption is logical and obvious.

### Don’t use when
- Don’t use for complex tasks, such as a multi-step process or a flow that requires many interactions. Consider using a separate page instead.
- Don’t use when displaying system errors as the primary pattern. Prefer an [Alert](/components/alert) or [Error Message](/components/error-message/) instead (exception: load-time errors inside the sheet).

### Don’t
- Don’t stack or nest modal surfaces (Bottom Sheets, modals, panels). Use one modal layer at a time.

## Placement
- The Bottom Sheet sticks to the bottom of the viewport.
- When a keyboard is visible on a mobile device, the Bottom Sheet sticks to the top of the keyboard (the keyboard does not cover the Bottom Sheet).

## Content strategy
- **MUST** use sentence case for the Bottom Sheet title (e.g., “Choose a date”).
- **MUST NOT** use Title Case for the Bottom Sheet title (e.g., avoid “Choose A Date”).
- Keep the title short and specific to the task.

## Anatomy
1. Layout container
2. Scrim (overlay/backdrop)
3. Sheet container
4. Header
5. Title
6. Close icon button
7. Content
8. Action area (optional; e.g., primary/secondary CTA)

## Behavior
### Dismissing
Bottom Sheets can be dismissed by (when supported by your platform/API):
1. Tapping/clicking the scrim (outside the Bottom Sheet)
2. Tapping/clicking the close button
3. Activating a CTA in the optional action area (only if that CTA is intended to close the sheet)
4. Pressing the `Escape` key (desktop/web)

If the Bottom Sheet contains unsaved user input, dismissal behavior **SHOULD** be guarded (e.g., confirm before discarding).

### Responsiveness
#### Width
- On smaller screens, the Bottom Sheet width is 100% of the viewport width.
- On larger screens, it has a max-width of 768px and is centered horizontally within the viewport.

#### Height
- By default, the height of the Bottom Sheet is determined by its content.
- The height of the Bottom Sheet can also be set to a fixed value when needed (e.g., for scrollable content).
- The maximum height is constrained so the sheet never fully covers the viewport:
  - Small widths (0–599px): max height = 100% of screen height minus 16px
  - 600px and above: max height = 100% of screen height minus 64px

## Accessibility
- When the Bottom Sheet opens, focus **SHOULD** move into the sheet (typically to the title or first focusable control) and remain within the modal while open.
- When the Bottom Sheet closes, focus **MUST** return to the element that triggered it.
- Avoid launching a snackbar at the same moment the Bottom Sheet closes; focus will not be on the snackbar so it may not be announced by screen readers.
  - If you must show a snackbar after closing, consider adding a short delay (commonly ~1 second) before triggering it. See the [Snackbar React FAQs](/develop/react/components/snackbar/#faq) for a web-specific workaround.

## Token usage
- Prefer component defaults (Bottom Sheet should be token-wired for color, typography, spacing, radius, elevation, and motion).
- Only use tokens for layout around the Bottom Sheet, not for restyling internal Bottom Sheet surfaces.

## React usage (example)
Update import path after wiring in `guidelines/components/overview-components.md`.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { BottomSheet } from "REPLACE_ME_COMPONENT_IMPORT_PATH";
import { Button } from "REPLACE_ME_COMPONENT_IMPORT_PATH";

export function BottomSheetExample() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);
  const triggerRef = React.useRef<HTMLButtonElement | null>(null);

  return (
    <>
      <Button
        ref={triggerRef}
        variant="primary"
        onClick={() => setOpen(true)}
      >
        Open bottom sheet
      </Button>

      <BottomSheet
        open={open}
        title="Choose a date"
        onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
        // Prefer APIs that automatically restore focus to the trigger;
        // if your API requires it, restore focus in onClose.
      >
        {/* Keep the task short and focused; content may scroll at max height. */}
      </BottomSheet>
    </>
  );
}
```
