## Purpose
A Menu reveals additional actions a user can take when space is limited. Menus are intended for **actions** (e.g., edit, export, delete), not for choosing a value from a set of options.

## Rules
- **MUST** use the Living Design Menu component.
- **MUST** use Menu for **actions/functions**, not for selection controls.
- **MUST** provide a clear trigger (most commonly an [Icon Button](/components/icon-button/) or [Button](/components/button/)).
- **MUST** ensure Menu items have clear, specific labels that describe the action.
- **MUST** support documented keyboard interactions (open, navigate, activate, dismiss).
- **MUST NOT** use Menu for main navigation or information architecture; use navigational components (e.g., [Link](/components/link/)) or a purpose-built navigation component.
- **MUST NOT** use a **primary** Button variant as the Menu trigger.

## Usage
A Menu is used when additional actions or functions are available to the user and space is limited.

### Position
The Menu can be placed above or below a trigger and will be either left-aligned or right-aligned to the trigger. Prefer placements that:
- Keep the Menu fully visible within the viewport/container
- Avoid covering the trigger when possible
- Follow platform conventions (e.g., align to trigger edge, flip when near edges)

## Best practices
### Use when
- Use when multiple actions can be taken, such as editing, exporting, deleting, etc.

### Don’t use when
- Don’t use when a user is making a selection or picking an option. Use [Select](/components/select/) or platform-native selection controls (e.g., radio group) instead.
- Don’t use for a product’s main navigation or where SEO is essential; use a [Link](/components/link/) or custom navigation component instead.

## Do / Don’t
### Do
- Do use Menu with an [Icon Button](/components/icon-button/) or a [Button](/components/button/) as a trigger.

### Don’t
- Don’t use Menu with a **primary** variant Button as a trigger.

## Content strategy
Just like a [Button](/components/button/#content-strategy), the Menu item’s text label should tell the user what action they’re about to take.

- Don’t use “Learn more” or “More details” (too vague).
- People mostly look at the first 2 words, so start the copy with the most important words.
- Leading icons (if supported) should provide additional clarity. Reference the [Best Practices](/foundations/icons/#best-practices/) under Icons for guidance on which icons to use.

## Anatomy
### Menu
1. Container
2. Menu item (repeating)

### Menu item
1. Container
2. Leading icon (optional)
3. Text label

## Behavior
### Opening
- Menu opens from a trigger (e.g., icon button / button).
- Menu should anchor to the trigger and adapt (flip/shift) to remain in view.

### Closing
A Menu can be closed in the following ways:
1. Clicking on the initial trigger again.
2. Clicking on a Menu item, triggering the action.
3. Clicking outside the Menu.
4. Pressing the Escape key.

## Accessibility
- The trigger **MUST** be keyboard-focusable and have an accessible name (visible label or `aria-label` for icon-only triggers).
- Opening the Menu **MUST** be possible via keyboard (typically Enter/Space on the trigger).
- Users **MUST** be able to navigate items with the keyboard and activate an item with Enter/Space (exact keys depend on the component’s documented behavior).
- Focus management **MUST** be handled by the component (focus moves into the Menu on open, returns to the trigger on close).
- Each Menu item **MUST** have a clear accessible name that matches the visible label.

## Token usage
- Prefer component defaults (Menu should be token-wired for surface, elevation, spacing, typography, and interaction states).
- Only use tokens for layout around the Menu/trigger, not for restyling Menu internals.

## React usage (example)
Update import path after wiring in `guidelines/components/overview-components.md`.

```tsx
import { Button, Menu, MenuItem } from "REPLACE_ME_COMPONENT_IMPORT_PATH";

export function Example() {
  return (
    <Menu
      trigger={<Button variant="secondary">More</Button>}
      aria-label="More actions"
    >
      <MenuItem onSelect={() => {}}>Edit</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem onSelect={() => {}}>Export</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem onSelect={() => {}}>Delete</MenuItem>
    </Menu>
  );
}
```
