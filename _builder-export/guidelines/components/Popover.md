## Purpose
A Popover is a **non-modal dialog** that displays supporting content anchored to a trigger. It can contain instructions, a short list of options, and lightweight actions without taking the user away from the current context.

## Rules
- **MUST** use the Living Design `Popover` component.
- **MUST** pair Popover with a **clickable / keyboard-focusable trigger** element.
- **MUST** open Popover only in response to **user demand** (e.g., click, Enter, Space) — never on page load.
- **MUST** include at least **one focusable element** inside the Popover (e.g., link, button, input) and provide a clear close path.
- **MUST** support dismissal via **Escape** and by interacting **outside** the Popover (per the component API).
- **MUST NOT** use Popover to display complex information or multi-step flows; use a dedicated screen or a [Modal](/components/modal/) instead.
- **MUST NOT** use Popover for “choose one” selection controls; use [Select](/components/select/) or a radio group instead.

## Usage
A Popover is a non-modal dialog that can display a variety of content, instructions, options, and actions. The component should be paired with a clickable trigger element and contain at least one focusable element.

## Best practices
### Use when
- Use when providing relevant supporting information or actions.
- Use when presenting a short list of options to be taken on the current view.

### Don’t use when
- Don’t use when displaying complex information.
- Don’t use when the resulting interaction flow requires multiple steps.
- Don’t use when a user is making a selection or picking an option. Use [Select](/components/select/) or a radio group instead.
- Don’t use when the Popover is displayed without user demand (e.g., on page load).

## Anatomy
- **Layout container**
- **Container**
- **Content**
- **Nubbin (optional)**

## Accessibility
- The trigger **MUST** be keyboard-focusable and have an accessible name (visible label, or `aria-label` for icon-only triggers).
- If the Popover content is dialog-like, it **MUST** have an accessible name (e.g., via a visible title wired to `aria-labelledby`, or `aria-label`).
- Focus management **MUST** be handled by the component:
  - On open, focus moves into the Popover (typically to the first focusable element).
  - On close, focus returns to the trigger.
- Keyboard interaction **MUST** be supported:
  - Enter/Space opens from the trigger.
  - Escape closes.
  - Tab/Shift+Tab navigates through focusable content.

## Token usage
- Prefer component defaults (Popover should be token-wired for surface, elevation, radius, spacing, typography, and interaction states).
- Only use tokens for layout around the trigger/Popover, not for restyling Popover internals.

## React usage (example)
Update import path after wiring in `guidelines/components/overview-components.md`.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Button, Popover } from "REPLACE_ME_COMPONENT_IMPORT_PATH";

export function PopoverExample() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <Popover
      // Adapt prop names to your actual API:
      // trigger={<Button variant="secondary">More options</Button>}
      // open={open}
      // onOpenChange={setOpen}
      // placement="bottom-start"
      trigger={
        <Button variant="secondary" aria-haspopup="dialog">
          More options
        </Button>
      }
      open={open}
      onOpenChange={setOpen}
      aria-label="More options"
    >
      <div>
        <p>Choose an action for this item.</p>
        <Button variant="secondary" onClick={() => setOpen(false)}>
          Cancel
        </Button>
        <Button onClick={() => setOpen(false)}>Confirm</Button>
      </div>
    </Popover>
  );
}
```

## Do / Don’t
### Do
- Use Popover for **supporting** information and lightweight actions.
- Keep content **short and scannable**, and include at least one focusable element.
- Ensure the user can **dismiss** it quickly (Escape and outside click).

### Don’t
- Don’t open Popover automatically on page load.
- Don’t use Popover for complex content or multi-step flows.
- Don’t use Popover as a selection control (use [Select](/components/select/) or a radio group).
