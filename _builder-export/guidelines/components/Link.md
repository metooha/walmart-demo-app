## Purpose
Links are **navigational** elements. They take users to a different page/screen, a different site, or a location within the same page.

## Rules
- **MUST** use the Living Design Link component.
- **MUST** use Link for navigation (including in-page anchors).
- **MUST NOT** use Link to perform a non-navigation action on the current page/screen; use a [Button](/components/button/) or [Link Button](/components/link-button/) instead.
- **MUST** ensure link text is concise and describes the destination or outcome.
- **MUST** support focus-visible and meet color contrast requirements via component defaults (do not restyle with custom CSS).
- **MUST NOT** turn large blocks of content (e.g., a whole paragraph) into a single Link.

## Usage
Links can be:
- Inserted within a line of text
- Used on their own (standalone)
- Placed at the end of content (e.g., “Read more” patterns — but the visible label should still be specific)

Links are appropriate for navigating:
- Within the application
- To a different site
- To another element on the same screen (in-page anchor)
- To email, phone number, or other external handlers

## Variants
Use documented Link variants only (e.g., default vs subtle, inline vs standalone). Do not create new styles via custom CSS.

## States
- Default
- Hover/active (web)
- Focus-visible
- Visited (if supported/desired by the system)
- Disabled (only if your Link component supports it; otherwise remove the affordance)

## Accessibility
- Use `link` semantics (`<a>` or equivalent) for navigation.
- The accessible name **MUST** match the visible label.
- If the Link is icon-only (if supported), **MUST** provide an accessible name (e.g., `aria-label`).
- For links that open a new tab/window (if supported/used), **MUST** communicate this to users (visually and/or via accessible text), and use safe `rel` values when using `target="_blank"`.
- Keyboard users **MUST** be able to reach Links and see a visible focus indicator.

## Token usage
- Prefer component defaults (Link should be token-wired for color, typography, and interaction states).
- Only use tokens for layout around the Link, not to restyle the Link itself.

## React usage (example)

```tsx
import { Link } from "@/components/ui/Link";

export function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Internal navigation */}
      <Link href="/account">Account settings</Link>

      {/* External navigation (auto-adds security attributes) */}
      <Link href="https://example.com" target="_blank">
        View documentation
      </Link>

      {/* In-page anchor */}
      <Link href="#billing">Jump to billing</Link>

      {/* Subtle variant */}
      <Link href="/help" variant="subtle">Help center</Link>

      {/* No underline (reveals on hover) */}
      <Link href="/dashboard" underline={false}>Dashboard</Link>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Component API

```tsx
interface LinkProps {
  /**
   * The URL that the link points to (required)
   */
  href: string;

  /**
   * Visual variant of the link
   * - 'default': Black text color with underline (default)
   * - 'subtle': Black text color with underline (same as default)
   */
  variant?: 'default' | 'subtle';

  /**
   * Whether to show underline
   * @default true
   */
  underline?: boolean;

  /**
   * Children content
   */
  children: React.ReactNode;

  /**
   * Target for the link (e.g., "_blank" for new tab)
   */
  target?: string;

  /**
   * Relationship attribute (auto-added for target="_blank")
   */
  rel?: string;
}
```

### Features

- **Auto-routing**: Automatically uses React Router for internal links (`/page`)
- **Security**: Auto-adds `rel="noreferrer noopener"` for `target="_blank"` links
- **Accessibility**: Built-in focus states and proper semantics
- **States**: Default, hover, active, visited, focus, and disabled

### Examples

**See full examples:** `client/components/LinkExample.tsx`

## Best practices
Links should be used as navigational elements to different pages or screens.

### Use when
- Use when navigating to a different page/screen within the application.
- Use when navigating to a different site.
- Use when jumping to another element on the same screen.
- Use when linking to email, phone number, etc.

### Don’t use when
- Don't use when performing a non-navigation action within a page or screen.

### Don’t
- Don’t turn a whole paragraph into a Link. A good Link is succinct and to the point.

## Content strategy
The text label should describe what information the user will get by clicking the Link.

- Don't use "Learn more" or "More details" which are vague.
- People mostly look at the first 2 words of a Link, so it's important to start the copy with the most important words.
