## Purpose
A Panel provides room for additional information or prompts users for input. Panels appear as a result of user interaction and **block access to the main content** until dismissed (modal behavior).

Use a Panel to complete a **secondary task** without navigating away from the current page (similar to a modal surface).

## Rules
- **MUST** use the Living Design Panel component.
- **MUST** open in response to a user action on an interactive element (e.g., a [Button](/components/button/)).
- **MUST** block interaction with underlying content while open (scrim + modal behavior).
- **MUST** be user-dismissible and provide at least one explicit dismissal control (e.g., close button).
- **MUST** support `Escape` to dismiss on desktop/web when applicable.
- **MUST** return focus to the element that triggered the Panel when it closes.
- **MUST NOT** use a Panel for primary tasks that should be part of the main page.
- **MUST NOT** use a Panel for prolonged interactions or repeatable/complex flows; consider a dedicated page/screen instead.
- **MUST NOT** layer a Panel on top of Bottom Sheet, Modal, or another Panel.

## Usage
Use a Panel to pause activity on the main page to complete a short, secondary task such as:
- Form input or edits
- Product sort/filter
- A focused list of secondary links/content

## Sizes
Panels are available in 3 widths (names may differ in your API). Use documented sizes only.

## Placement
The Panel can appear from either the **left** or **right** edge of the viewport. Choose the side that best matches your information architecture and avoids covering critical context.

## Anatomy
### Panel
1. Layout container
2. Scrim (overlay/backdrop)
3. Container
4. Header
5. Content
6. Action content (optional)

### Panel header
1. Container
2. Title
3. Close button

## Behavior
### Closing
A Panel can be closed in the following ways (when enabled in the component API):
1. Clicking or tapping the Close button/icon
2. Clicking or tapping the scrim (outside the Panel)
3. Pressing the `Escape` key on the keyboard

If the Panel contains unsaved user input, dismissal behavior **SHOULD** be guarded (e.g., confirm before discarding).

### Responsiveness
#### Width
- On smaller screens, the maximum width of the Panel **SHOULD** be viewport width minus 24px.
- On larger screens, width is determined by the selected Panel size.

#### Height
The Panel height should be 100% of the viewport height.

## Accessibility
- **MUST** trap focus while open and prevent interaction with underlying content.
- **MUST** return focus to the triggering element when the Panel closes.
- **SHOULD** avoid launching a snackbar at the same moment the Panel closes; focus will not be on the snackbar so it may not be announced by screen readers.
  - If you must show a snackbar after closing, consider adding a short delay (commonly ~1 second) before triggering it. See your system’s Snackbar docs/FAQ for platform-specific guidance.

## Token usage
- Prefer component defaults (Panel should be token-wired for scrim/elevation, spacing, typography, and surface styling).
- Only use tokens for layout around the Panel, not for restyling Panel internals.

## React usage (example)
Update import path after wiring in `guidelines/components/overview-components.md`.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Button, Panel } from "REPLACE_ME_COMPONENT_IMPORT_PATH";

export function PanelExample() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <Button variant="secondary" onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>
        Open panel
      </Button>

      <Panel
        // Adapt prop names to your actual API:
        // side="right" | "left"
        // size="sm" | "md" | "lg"
        // closeOnScrimClick={true}
        // closeOnEscape={true}
        open={open}
        onOpenChange={setOpen}
        title="Filters"
        side="right"
        size="md"
      >
        {/* Keep the task short and focused; content may scroll. */}
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Best practices
### Use when
- Use when completing a secondary task that temporarily pauses interaction with the main page.

### Don’t use when
- Don’t use for primary tasks that should remain on the main page.
- Don’t use for prolonged or repeatable tasks; consider a dedicated page/screen.

## Do / Don’t
### Do
- Do use Panels for short, secondary tasks like sorting/filtering or quick edits.
- Do ensure the Panel is clearly dismissible and restores focus to the trigger.

### Don’t
- Don’t stack Panels or combine with other modal surfaces (Modal, Bottom Sheet).
