# Component Visibility and Access

## Private Components

**NEVER use components marked as `@private`** in their JSDoc/docblock comments. These are internal implementation details and should not be used directly in application code.

### Rules

- Components marked `@private` are for internal use only
- Only use components that are documented and publicly exported
- If you need functionality from a private component, find the public API that exposes it

### Examples of Private Components

Components like `OverlayScrim`, `Overlay.service`, and similar implementation details should never be imported or used directly. Always use the public-facing components that provide the intended functionality.

### How to Check

Look for JSDoc comments at the top of component files:

```tsx
/**
 * @private
 * Internal component - do not use directly
 */
```

If you see `@private` in the docblock, do not use that component.
