# Rule: Guidelines Page Sync

**Priority:** CRITICAL - ALWAYS ENFORCE  
**When:** After ANY change to files in the `guidelines/` directory

## Overview

The Component Library Guidelines page (`client/pages/component-library/Guidelines.tsx`) includes a **Documentation Index** tab that lists every guideline document in the project. This tab is powered by the `GuidelinesDocIndex` component (`client/pages/component-library/GuidelinesDocIndex.tsx`).

**This index must stay in sync with the actual `guidelines/` folder at all times.**

## Hard Rule

When you **add, remove, rename, or move** any file in the `guidelines/` directory (including subdirectories), you **MUST** also update the `docSections` array in:

```
client/pages/component-library/GuidelinesDocIndex.tsx
```

### What to update

1. **Adding a new guideline file** — Add a new entry to the appropriate section in `docSections` with `name`, `path`, and `purpose`.
2. **Removing a guideline file** — Remove the corresponding entry from `docSections`.
3. **Renaming a guideline file** — Update the `path` and `name` fields in the matching entry.
4. **Adding a new subdirectory** — If the document doesn't fit an existing section, add a new section object to `docSections`.

### Section mapping

| `guidelines/` subdirectory | `docSections` section title |
|---|---|
| `guidelines/components/` | Component Guidelines |
| `guidelines/design-system/` | Design System Foundations |
| `guidelines/rules/` | Enforcement Rules |
| `guidelines/` (root-level) | Cross-Cutting Guidelines |
| `guidelines/migrations/` and `guidelines/implementations/` | Migrations & Implementation History |

## Enforcement Checklist

Before marking any guideline-related task as complete, verify:

- [ ] The new/changed file is reflected in `GuidelinesDocIndex.tsx`
- [ ] The `name` field is human-readable
- [ ] The `purpose` field is a concise one-line description
- [ ] The `path` field matches the actual file path
- [ ] The entry is in the correct section

## Why This Rule Exists

Without this rule, the Component Library becomes stale — team members browsing the Guidelines page would not see newly added documentation, creating a disconnect between what exists in the codebase and what's visible in the UI. Keeping the index in sync ensures the Component Library is always the single source of truth for design system documentation.
