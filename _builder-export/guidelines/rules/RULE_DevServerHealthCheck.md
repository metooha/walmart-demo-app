# Rule: Dev Server Health Check

**Priority**: CRITICAL - ALWAYS ENFORCE  
**When**: After completing ANY code changes (component updates, style changes, new files, etc.)

---

## Rule

After finishing a set of code changes, you MUST:

1. **Check the dev server logs** using `DevServerControl` with `get_logs: true`
2. **Look for errors** in the output (compilation errors, HMR failures, module not found, etc.)
3. **Restart the dev server** if:
   - There are any compilation or build errors
   - HMR updates are not showing in the logs
   - The user reports a blank page or inability to view the app
4. **Confirm the page is loading** by verifying clean logs with no errors after restart

## Why

Vite HMR handles most file changes automatically, but certain changes (bad syntax in Tailwind arbitrary values, circular imports, deleted/moved files) can cause silent failures that result in a blank page. Proactively checking prevents the user from having to report the issue.

## Checklist

After every completed task:

- [ ] Ran `DevServerControl` with `get_logs: true`
- [ ] Verified no compilation errors in logs
- [ ] Restarted if any errors were found
- [ ] Confirmed clean startup after restart

## Example

```
// After making changes:
1. DevServerControl({ get_logs: true })
2. Check for errors in output
3. If errors found → DevServerControl({ restart: true })
4. Verify clean startup
```
