# Attribution Dropdown Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Built

A fully functional attribution interval dropdown that dynamically adjusts campaign metrics based on the selected attribution window.

---

## 📦 Components Updated

### 1. **AttributionFilterDropdown.tsx**
**Changes:**
- ✅ Added Living Design Button imports
- ✅ Replaced inline button styles with `<Button>` and `<ButtonGroup>` components
- ✅ Cancel button: `variant="secondary"` 
- ✅ Apply button: `variant="primary"`
- ✅ Both buttons use `size="small"` with pill-shaped borders

**Features:**
- 5 attribution window options: 7, 14, 30, 60, 90 days
- Temporary selection state (can cancel changes)
- Apply/Cancel pattern with Living Design buttons
- Popover-based UI for clean UX

---

### 2. **SponsoredSearchDashboard.tsx**
**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `useEffect` hook to recalculate metrics when attribution changes
- ✅ Created dynamic metrics state that adjusts based on attribution window
- ✅ Updated all 5 metric displays to use dynamic values
- ✅ Added visual attribution info badge
- ✅ Implemented campaign data adjustment based on attribution

**Metrics Affected:**
1. **Impressions** - Adjusts ±5-8% based on attribution
2. **Clicks** - Adjusts ±5-10% based on attribution
3. **Cost Per Click (CPC)** - Inversely adjusts (longer window = lower CPC)
4. **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** - Adjusts ±5-7% based on attribution
5. **Ad Spend** - Adjusts ±2-8% based on attribution

## 🎯 How It Works

### Attribution Logic

Different attribution windows affect metrics differently:

| Attribution Window | Multiplier | Effect on Conversions |
|-------------------|------------|----------------------|
| **7 days** | 0.85 | Fewer conversions attributed (-15%) |
| **14 days** | 1.0 | Baseline (default) |
| **30 days** | 1.18 | More conversions attributed (+18%) |
| **60 days** | 1.32 | Even more conversions (+32%) |
| **90 days** | 1.45 | Most conversions attributed (+45%) |

### Why Metrics Change

**Longer attribution windows typically show:**
- ✅ Higher conversion rates (CVR)
- ✅ Better ROAS (more conversions credited)
- ✅ Slightly lower CPC (better perceived efficiency)
- ✅ Higher CTR (more engaged users)

**Shorter attribution windows show:**
- ⚠️ Lower conversion rates (fewer conversions captured)
- ⚠️ Lower ROAS
- ⚠️ Higher CPC
- ⚠️ Lower CTR

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```tsx
// Attribution state
const [attribution, setAttribution] = useState<string>("14 days attribution");

// Dynamic metrics state
const [metrics, setMetrics] = useState({
  impressions: 18689154,
  clicks: 148782,
  cpc: 1.36,
  ctr: 0.84,
  adSpend: 195607
});

// Recalculate on attribution change
useEffect(() => {
  const attributionDays = parseInt(attribution.split(" ")[0]);
  const multiplier = getMultiplier(attributionDays);
  
  // Adjust all metrics
  setMetrics({
    impressions: Math.round(baseMetrics.impressions * multiplier),
    clicks: Math.round(baseMetrics.clicks * multiplier),
    // ... etc
  });
}, [attribution]);
```

### Button Implementation
```tsx
// Old inline style
<button className="px-4 py-2 text-sm font-bold text-white bg-[#0053E2] rounded-full">
  Apply
</button>

// New Living Design
<Button variant="primary" size="small">
  Apply
</Button>
```

## 📚 Documentation

### For Developers
```tsx
// Import the component
import AttributionFilterDropdown from "@/components/AttributionFilterDropdown";

// Use in your page
<AttributionFilterDropdown
  value={attribution}
  onApply={(value) => setAttribution(value)}
/>
```

### For Users
**What is attribution?**
Attribution determines how long after clicking an ad we count a conversion. Longer windows capture more conversions but may include conversions that would have happened anyway.

**Which window should I use?**
- **7 days**: Fast-moving products, impulse purchases
- **14 days**: Standard e-commerce (default)
- **30 days**: Considered purchases
- **60-90 days**: High-value, long sales cycles
