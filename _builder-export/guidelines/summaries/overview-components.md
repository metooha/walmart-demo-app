## Rules
- **MUST** use Living Design components when a matching component exists.
- **MUST NOT** recreate common UI controls with raw HTML/CSS if a component exists.
- **MUST** match component variants/states exactly as documented (no ad-hoc variants).
- **MUST** rely on component defaults for tokens; only override with documented props/tokens.
- **MUST NOT** invent new props or component names.

## Fill this in after copying into the real repo
- **Component library package name / import path**:
  - `REPLACE_ME` (example: `@living-design/ui`)
- **Storybook / docs URL (optional)**:
  - `REPLACE_ME`

## Component selection hierarchy
When building UI:
1. **Use an existing component** (preferred).
2. If no component exists, **compose** from smaller Living Design primitives (if you have them).
3. If neither exists, **ask** whether to add a new component vs proceed with a one-off.

## States that must be handled (where applicable)
Agents must ensure components support/represent:
- Default
- Hover / active (web)
- Focus-visible (keyboard)
- Disabled
- Error / validation (for form controls)

## Token usage in components
Components should already be wired to tokens. Agents should:
- Prefer props that select variants (e.g., `variant="primary"`, `size="large"`)
- Avoid inline styles; prefer className hooks only if documented
- Use tokens only when composing layouts around components (spacing, container surfaces, etc.)
