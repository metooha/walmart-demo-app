# Radix UI Removal — Migration Plan

> **Goal**: Remove all `@radix-ui/react-*` dependencies from the project and replace with native HTML/React implementations that preserve accessibility and behavior.

---

## 1. Current State

**27 Radix packages** in `package.json` (devDependencies).  
**20 component files** under `client/components/ui/` import from `@radix-ui`.  
**6 packages** are listed in package.json but never imported anywhere.  
**6 component files** using Radix are never imported outside their own file (dead code).

---

## 2. Phase 0 — Quick Wins (No Code Changes Required)

Remove unused packages from `package.json` and delete dead-code component files.

### Unused Packages (not imported anywhere in the codebase)

| Package | Action |
|---|---|
| `@radix-ui/react-hover-card` | Remove from package.json |
| `@radix-ui/react-progress` | Remove from package.json |
| `@radix-ui/react-switch` | Remove from package.json |
| `@radix-ui/react-tabs` | Remove from package.json |
| `@radix-ui/react-toast` | Remove from package.json |
| `@radix-ui/react-separator` | Remove from package.json |

### Dead-Code Component Files (not imported outside their own file)

| File | Radix Package | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `client/components/ui/aspect-ratio.tsx` | `react-aspect-ratio` | Delete file, remove package |
| `client/components/ui/form.tsx` | `react-slot` (type import) | Delete file |
| `client/components/ui/label.tsx` | `react-label` | Delete file, remove package |
| `client/components/ui/Popover.tsx` (uppercase) | `react-popover` | Delete file (lowercase `popover.tsx` is the active one) |
| `client/components/ui/sidebar.tsx` | `react-slot` | Delete file |
| `client/components/ui/toggle-group.tsx` | `react-toggle-group` | Delete file, remove package |

**After Phase 0**: 21 packages removed or queued for removal. 6 files deleted.

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Example/Demo-Only Components

These components are only imported by their example files in `client/components/examples/` and displayed on component library pages. They are not used in any production page or feature.

**Strategy**: Rewrite each component using native HTML elements, React state, and CSS. The component's public API (props, exported names) must stay identical so examples don't break.

### Priority Order (simplest first)

| # | Component File | Radix Package | Complexity | Replacement Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `collapsible.tsx` | `react-collapsible` | Simple | Native `<details>`/`<summary>` or React state + `aria-expanded` |
| 2 | `toggle.tsx` | `react-toggle` | Simple | `<button>` with `aria-pressed` + React state |
| 3 | `avatar.tsx` | `react-avatar` | Simple | `<img>` with `onError` fallback to initials `<span>` |
| 4 | `slider.tsx` | `react-slider` | Simple | Native `<input type="range">` with custom track/thumb CSS |
| 5 | `accordion.tsx` | `react-accordion` | Medium | `<details>`/`<summary>` or React state + `aria-expanded` + CSS transitions |
| 6 | `tooltip.tsx` | `react-tooltip` | Medium | CSS `:hover`/`:focus` tooltip with `role="tooltip"` + `aria-describedby`, or React state with portal |
| 7 | `scroll-area.tsx` | `react-scroll-area` | Medium | Native CSS `overflow: auto` with custom scrollbar styles (`::-webkit-scrollbar`) |
| 8 | `popover.tsx` (lowercase) | `react-popover` | Medium | React state + portal + `useFloating` positioning (or manual positioning), focus trap, click-outside handler |
| 9 | `dropdown-menu.tsx` | `react-dropdown-menu` | Medium | `<button>` trigger + positioned `<div role="menu">` with `<div role="menuitem">`, keyboard nav (arrow keys, Escape, Home/End) |
| 10 | `context-menu.tsx` | `react-context-menu` | Medium | `onContextMenu` handler + positioned menu (same pattern as dropdown-menu) |
| 11 | `menubar.tsx` | `react-menubar` | Medium | `<div role="menubar">` with `<button role="menuitem">` triggers, sub-menus, arrow key navigation |
| 12 | `navigation-menu.tsx` | `react-navigation-menu` | Medium | `<nav>` with `<ul>`/`<li>` structure, dropdown sub-menus, keyboard nav |
| 13 | `alert-dialog.tsx` | `react-alert-dialog` | Medium | Same as Modal but with `role="alertdialog"` and required action buttons |
| 14 | `command.tsx` | `react-dialog` (type only) | Simple | Remove the type import; use local type definition. Main UI is `cmdk`, not Radix. |

### What each replacement must include

- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys, Escape to close, Enter/Space to activate, Tab for focus management
- **ARIA attributes**: `role`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-selected`, `aria-checked`, `aria-labelledby`, etc.
- **Focus management**: Focus trapping for modals/dialogs, return focus on close, `tabindex` management
- **Click-outside handling**: Close overlays when clicking outside (use a `useClickOutside` hook)
- **Portal rendering**: Overlays (modals, popovers, dropdowns) should render in a portal to avoid z-index/overflow issues
- **Animation**: CSS transitions for open/close states using data attributes or CSS classes

---

## 4. Phase 2 — Production-Critical Components

These are used in actual app pages and features. Migration must be done carefully with testing.

| # | Component File | Radix Package | Used By | Complexity | Replacement Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Modal.tsx` | `react-dialog` | Example only currently, but Modal is a core UI primitive | Medium | `<dialog>` element (native HTML) with `showModal()`/`close()`, `::backdrop` for overlay, focus trap, Escape to close |
| 2 | `Checkbox.tsx` | `react-checkbox` | `DataTableCellSelect.tsx`, `MartyFloatingPanel.tsx`, `ComponentTester.tsx`, examples | Medium | Native `<input type="checkbox">` with custom styling via `appearance: none` + pseudo-elements for indicator, `aria-checked` |
| 3 | `Radio.tsx` + `radio-group.tsx` | `react-radio-group` | Examples, `FormGroupExample.tsx` | Medium-High | Native `<input type="radio">` with `name` grouping, custom styling, remove MutationObserver (use React state/context instead of watching Radix data attributes) |
| 4 | `Select.tsx` | `react-select` | `Index.tsx` (app page), examples | **High** | Native `<select>` with custom dropdown overlay, or a custom listbox pattern (`<div role="listbox">` + `<div role="option">`). Must support: keyboard nav, portal positioning, error states, helper text, `aria-activedescendant` |

### Select.tsx — Detailed Replacement Plan

This is the most complex migration item. The current implementation uses ~15 Radix primitives.

**Option A: Native `<select>` element**
- Pros: Full browser accessibility for free, keyboard nav built in, mobile-friendly
- Cons: Limited styling control (can't style the dropdown options across browsers)
- Best for: If visual customization of the dropdown isn't critical

**Option B: Custom listbox pattern**
- Build a custom component using `role="listbox"` and `role="option"`
- Implement: trigger button, positioned dropdown portal, keyboard navigation (arrow keys, type-ahead, Home/End), focus management, scroll into view
- Use CSS for positioning (or a lightweight positioning utility)
- This is significant work (~300-400 lines) but gives full styling control

**Recommendation**: Option B (custom listbox) to maintain current visual design. Create a shared `useListbox` hook for keyboard navigation logic that can be reused by other components.

## 5. Phase 3 — Shared Utilities

Before starting Phase 1-2 replacements, create these reusable utilities:

| Utility | Purpose | Used By |
|---|---|---|
| `useClickOutside(ref, handler)` | Close overlays on outside click | Popover, Dropdown, Select, Modal, ContextMenu |
| `useFocusTrap(ref, active)` | Trap focus inside overlay | Modal, AlertDialog, Dialog |
| `useEscapeKey(handler)` | Close on Escape press | All overlays |
| `useListboxNavigation(items)` | Arrow key navigation for list-based components | Select, DropdownMenu, ContextMenu, Menubar, Command |
| `Portal` component | Render children in a portal | All overlays |
| `Slot` component | Polymorphic `asChild` pattern | Replace `@radix-ui/react-slot` usage |

**Location**: `client/hooks/` for hooks, `client/components/ui/Portal.tsx` and `client/components/ui/Slot.tsx` for components.

---

## 6. Execution Order

```
Phase 0  →  Phase 3 (utilities)  →  Phase 1 (demo-only)  →  Phase 2 (production)
```

1. **Phase 0**: Remove unused packages and dead code files
2. **Phase 3**: Build shared utilities (hooks + Portal + Slot)
3. **Phase 1**: Replace demo-only components (simplest first)
4. **Phase 2**: Replace production components (Checkbox → Radio → Modal → Select)

After each component replacement:
- Verify the component library page still renders correctly
- Verify keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys)
- Verify screen reader announces states correctly
- Run `pnpm build` to check for type errors

---

## 7. Packages to Remove (Final Checklist)

After all phases are complete, remove these from `package.json`:

| Package | Removed In |
|---|---|
| `@radix-ui/react-accordion` | Phase 1 |
| `@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog` | Phase 1 |
| `@radix-ui/react-aspect-ratio` | Phase 0 |
| `@radix-ui/react-avatar` | Phase 1 |

| `@radix-ui/react-collapsible` | Phase 1 |
| `@radix-ui/react-context-menu` | Phase 1 |
| `@radix-ui/react-dialog` | Phase 2 |
| `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu` | Phase 1 |
| `@radix-ui/react-hover-card` | Phase 0 |

| `@radix-ui/react-tabs` | Phase 0 |
| `@radix-ui/react-toast` | Phase 0 |
| `@radix-ui/react-toggle` | Phase 1 |
| `@radix-ui/react-toggle-group` | Phase 0 |
| `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` | Phase 1 |

---

## 8. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Accessibility regression | High | Test every component with keyboard and screen reader after replacement |
| Select.tsx replacement breaks Index.tsx | High | Keep the same public API (props, exports); test the page after migration |
| Focus management bugs in modals/dialogs | Medium | Use the shared `useFocusTrap` hook consistently |
| Positioning issues in popovers/dropdowns | Medium | Test at different viewport sizes and scroll positions |
| Animation differences | Low | Use CSS transitions with consistent timing; match existing animation behavior |

---

## 9. Dependencies After Migration

After full migration, the project will have **zero** `@radix-ui` dependencies. The only external UI-behavior dependency will be `cmdk` (used by `command.tsx` for the command palette). `cmdk` itself depends on `@radix-ui/react-dialog` internally, so if you want to fully remove Radix from the dependency tree, `cmdk` would also need to be replaced or a Radix-free fork used.

---

## 10. Definition of Done

- [ ] `pnpm build` succeeds with no errors
- [ ] All component library pages render and function correctly
- [ ] All production pages (Index.tsx, LandingSummary.tsx) function correctly
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works on all interactive components
- [ ] No accessibility regressions (ARIA attributes, focus management, screen reader support)
